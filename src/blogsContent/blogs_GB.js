      '<p>Innovation has been a top priority for the majority of leaders, both at company level and government level. However, deciding which approach will deliver the best ROI in innovation endeavor is not always easy. That is where innovation management comes into play. It takes innovation from a creative-thinking exclusive activity to a logically managed and measurable process. It leverages the collective intelligence of all to identify, curate, and implement the best ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we are going to examine the concept of innovation management, the key aspects of innovation management, and its methodologies and approaches.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>So, first things first, what Is Innovation Management?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of innovation management was first formulated by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter in his book<em> Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</em> first published in 1943, in which he developed the term &ldquo;creative destruction&rdquo;, referring to industrial forces revolutionizing economic structured from within. Since then, several scholars, thinkers, and entrepreneurs have further developed the theory of innovation management.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we are going to adopt the definition by <a href="https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/innovation-management/">Gartner</a>, an IT research and consultancy company, innovation management is a <a href="https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/business-innovation">business</a> discipline that aims to drive a sustainable innovation process or culture within an organization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By simply looking at the definition, innovation management is the systematic process of coming up and developing new things, be it a product, workflow, business model, or system and the fostering of innovation culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The key aspects of innovation management</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are various aspects involved in innovation management, they usually include management of the following areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ideation</strong>: Making sure ideas from internal or external stakeholders are collected, refined, and implemented efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Ensuring that capabilities and materials are at disposal for bringing about innovative changes &ndash; including but not limited to funding, human capital, time, and information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Structures</strong>: Structures enable the effective use of the resources. In practice, this means improving the organizational structure, processes, and infrastructure to optimize innovation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strategy</strong>: Harnessing resources and ideas to reach innovation goals incrementally or disruptively. Ultimately, innovation is simply one of the means - arguably the most important one, to achieving your strategic goals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Culture</strong>: Creating a pro-innovation culture where new ideas are encouraged, and stakeholders are incentivised to share and comment on insights. It also enables the organization to acquire the best people to achieve its innovation goals, and ultimately, its success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation management always entails establishing a process by which a company can continuously and effectively promote innovative activity. To be effective at managing innovation, it is essential to be able to understand both the big picture, as well as the individual components that make it up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The methodologies &amp; approaches of innovation management</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation management is complicated, it helps to look at some of the more widely accepted theories and approaches to choose one that fits best to your organization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The types of innovation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The two broad methodology categories that innovation management typically falls into are &lsquo;incremental&rsquo; and &lsquo;disruptive&rsquo;. While the former involves making consistent improvements to existing products, services, or work processes, the latter involves introducing bolder changes which carry more risk but the possibility of large-scale returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg Satell, writer and innovation adviser developed a system called &ldquo;The Innovation Matrix&rdquo;, mapping out the four different types of innovation: basic research, sustaining innovation, disruptive innovation, and breakthrough innovation depending on how well the domain and the problem are defined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are going to combine both, and categorize innovation into 4 different types: incremental &amp; sustaining, incremental &amp; disruptive, radical &amp; sustaining, and radical &amp; disruptive innovations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gEQhnVN0zi7E8UBo73AGBmvYRDlFlu9LelaG6Ie2k3IMqENbKTfqLFdyUuZSWrn92NH0FxWzhGzsZWoGOaKqQbJ3V0-HV1mc55rF684iFGAR2l5YdcpfrXaKaMBOYkEnT7khHDEV" style="height:379px; width:624px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The approaches to innovation management</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In her famous blog &ldquo;Future of CIO&rdquo;, Pearl Zhu, author and innovation expert summarizes the three management approaches to improve the innovation management success rate in the digital era: an emergent approach, an iterative approach, and an integrative approach. We will combine her insight with our research and experience working with organizations to propose the following three approaches:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The proactive approach</strong>: Proactive innovation management and continuous adaptability are essential in today&rsquo;s rapidly changing world. Managing, changes and innovations should not wait until there is an immediate pressing task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The integrative approach:</strong> It focuses on how innovation can be best accommodated within an organization&rsquo;s existing structure to create value, and to ensure future growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The customer-centric approach</strong>: To make sure an innovation will have a positive impact on customers, partners, suppliers, and other stakeholders, the best way is to seek out input from all of them in your innovation endeavors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no size one size fit all success approach for innovation management. It is important for an organization to choose an approach or a mix of different approaches that best address their business. You can also choose different approaches to address different aspects of the business to innovation is managed in the most systematic and efficient way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next article of the same series, we will continue introducing the common models of innovation management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

      '<p>In the last blog post of the same series, we went through the definition of innovation management, the key aspects of it, and its methodologies and approaches. In this following series, before going through the common models of innovation management, let us take a look at what successful innovation management actually look like.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What does successful innovation management look like?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no simple answer to this question, as it is always dependent on the unique situation of each organization. However, the most innovative companies are normally the ones where the 5 aspects of innovation management - ideation, resources, structures, strategy, and culture aligned with each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From our research, organizations that are considered to be the most innovative, creating disruptive products or technologies all the time tend to have these common characteristics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have a unique, clearly defined, and relevant strategy that everyone at the organization understands;</li>\r\n\t<li>Accept that failure is always a possibility and are not afraid of it;</li>\r\n\t<li>Structure a repeatable and sustainable innovation process;</li>\r\n\t<li>Trust, encourage, and reward talents;</li>\r\n\t<li>Organize around small teams;</li>\r\n\t<li>Have cross-functional teams with autonomy;</li>\r\n\t<li>Have the resources and structures in place for making sure things happen.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Common models of innovation management</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation management is complicated. To achieve the best possible results in doing it, and to be successful at innovation management, there are some common models organizations could choose from according to their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common processes for innovation management:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Technology Push vs. Market Pull</li>\r\n\t<li>Phase-Gate Process</li>\r\n\t<li>Lean Startup Model</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Technology Push vs. Market Pull</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The push-based model is a more internally and technologically driven approach, whereas pull-based model is more customer and market-oriented approach for managing innovation. In other words, technology push model is the one where products and processes at the core of innovation, usually driven by internal or external R&amp;D activities, whereas market pull model is driven by and designed to meet the market demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Push-oriented organizations usually focus on searching for the best ways to address the challenges and the users, usually with new technology. Pull-oriented organizations, in contrast, are looking for ways to adapt to changing markets and customer demand, and usually focus on listening to customers, learning from them and moving fast in their innovation work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While push-oriented organizations are usually traditional and established ones, and pull-oriented ones are operating at an early stage, such as startups, they could usually intertwine. For example, some startups are building technology to solve problems using the push-based model, while some large organizations are taking radical initiatives within the organization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no better or worse here - they are simply aiming for addressing different challenges. The question to ask is which one of the approaches fit your organization or your need before you choose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Phase-Gate Process</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The phase-gate process (also referred to as a stage-gate process or waterfall process) is probably the most well-known model in developing a new project, product, process, or business initiative. It has been around since the 1940s, and was further refined by Robert Cooper in the 1980s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The process separates the idea development process into five main phases. Between phases, a gate is used to determine whether the development should move to the next phase or an iteration should be applied in the current phase before moving to the next one. It is mainly used to reduce project uncertainty and cycle time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mG9N0EQBWYEN4Gov8rYe84Q9-NK2T9lLw-b1Rzao5HGzUmwNFYM_V-PUoMY3r8ksd2hfBJIQhAiGRNNaY6C2rNSzCGLnKaOEO72NBnAqb8cIoQjHl1woYziT_z9wPCs9_7dP4euc" style="height:201px; width:624px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phase-gate process guides idea development through five phases from ideation to launch as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 0: ideation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this phase, organizations tend to discover opportunities through brainstorming and market research among all its stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, suppliers, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 1: scoping</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main goal in this phase is to evaluate the idea and its market. The strengths and weaknesses of the idea, competition, and customer demand should all be evaluated to determine if the idea is going to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 2: building business case</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the last phase of concept development and is crucial before starting with the development of the actual product. There are four main steps to conclude this phase:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Product definition and analysis</strong>: This step provides information to define and justify the development of a new idea;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Building the business case</strong>: This step provides documents that define the idea;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Building the project plan</strong>: This is a list of all tasks that are planned during the entire development process, and the resources it takes to carry them out;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Feasibility review</strong>: This step analyzes the information provided to decide whether or not the product should move forward.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 3: development</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultimate deliverable of the development phase is the prototype, which will undergo extensive testing and evaluation in the next phase of the process. The product&#39;s marketing and production plans are also developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 4: testing and validation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The testing includes team testing for problems and issues in the product. Then, it goes for the field test, which includes consumer testing for the product in a beta version and a marketing test to identify market feasibility for the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 5: launch</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The product is introduced to the market based on a pre-defined marketing strategy. In this phase, the marketing and sales team play essential roles in creating the market need and increasing exposure for the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advantages of the phase-gate process is that it ensures consistency among your ideas and guarantees that each innovation matches the general standards. It also helps reduce complexity for large projects, making the decision-making process smoother. One problem with the process is it would potentially interfere with creativity and innovation, as overly structured processes may cause hinder the largely iterative process of innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Lean Startup Model</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The lean startup model is proposed by Eric Ries in his book of the same name. It is a methodology for product and business development. Although it usually is not considered as an innovation management process, it is designed with the same goal as the pull-oriented innovation management approach to address market risk and customer demand fast to find the product market fit as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main idea of the lean startup model is to rapidly test and validate the assumptions related to the product market fit between your idea or innovation and your target market in order to learn and adapt as fast as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Build-measure-learn</strong> is the main component of the lean startup model. It is a framework for establishing and continuously improving new ideas, products, and services quickly and cost-effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building <strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) </strong>is another main concept in this model. The idea is, instead of taking a lot of time and resources to build a product that nobody knows if there is a market fit, build the most version of it to test the water.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lean startup model is a faster way to learn what works. Organizations are able to increase the speed of development and reduce development costs, thus lowering the overall risk of innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What is the right model for your organization?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To figure out the right innovation management model for your organization can be challenging, as innovation is higher unpredictable and the only way to see if something works for you is to actually try it out. We do, however, have some tips to help you figure out it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Analyse your current situation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Educate yourself on all the models.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Start simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Keep testing until you find the right fit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And keep in mind that there is no right or wrong, better or worse, there is only fit or not fit. And if you are working in a larger organization, you will almost inevitably need more than one model for different types of innovations in different parts of the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next article of the series, we will take a look at key innovation metrics to drive innovation.

      '<p>In the previous articles of the same series, we have gone through the fundamentals of innovation management, where we learnt its definition, key aspects, approaches, and common models. In this one, we will discuss more on the key innovation metrics to measure and how to get the most of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metrics are important levers of innovation &ndash; for driving behavior, evaluating the results of specific initiatives, as well as guiding you in allocating resources. However, due to the abstract and somewhat uncertain nature of innovation, finding the right metrics to measure innovation can be tricky. It is easy to pick some metrics that are simple, without thinking whether they are the important ones that will actually be useful to your business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important thing in measuring innovation is to ensure that you are going in the right direction. To set the correct metrics, you should measure not only in the traditional ways, i.e. measuring return on investment, but also see if the organization, leadership, and resources are in line with your business goals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Input vs. output metrics</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To put it simply, the input and output metrics are used to measure what goes into your innovation process and what comes out of it. The input metrics are to measure if you are taking the right initiatives and if you are allocating your resources properly, whereas the output metrics are to measure the results they bring and if they are the desired results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Input metrics are a great starting point for measuring innovation in the early stage because they are straightforward and tangible. It is, however, important to have in mind that input does not guarantee output.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Key types of innovation metrics</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Broadly speaking, there are three types of metrics when it comes to measuring innovation - return on investment metrics, capability &amp; structure metrics, and leadership metrics. We will briefly introduce each type of them and some examples in regards to what exactly to measure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Return on investment metrics</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ROI metrics are the most straightforward metrics of all, they focus on measuring resource investments and financial returns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse; width:624px">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Input metrics</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Output metrics</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>No. of ideas submitted</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>No. of new products, services, and businesses launched</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>No. of campaign / challenge launched and no. of ideas submitted for each of them</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Revenue / profit gained from the new launches</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Money spent on implementing the ideas</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>No. of the new market entered</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Time spent on developing and implementing the ideas</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>% of the market share</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>% of ideas implemented vs ideas submitted</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Capability, culture &amp; structure metrics</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Capability and structure metrics refer to the infrastructure and process an organization has to facilitate innovation.

It is critical to engage key stakeholders in every process and make sure the metrics are not overwhelmed but are aligned with the business strategy and objectives. And one should also keep in mind that metrics should not be standing alone but rather a part of an organization&rsquo;s growth plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n'

    content: `<p>In the previous articles, we have examined the fundamentals of innovation management, how to measure innovation and get the most of it. In this article - the last article of the same series, we will go through the benefits an organization can get from properly managing innovation, which fundamentally answers the question of why innovation management is so important for organizations and why it is an absolute need.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Innovation is the key factor for the success of an organization. Creative and new products almost always come from an innovative team and management system. Fostering creativity and open and innovative culture is important, but it can be difficult to do so in a consistent and measurable way - this is where innovation management comes in! With proper innovation management and by using a dedicated Innovation Management Software (IMS), you can help your organization build a systematic innovation process.&nbsp;</p> <p><br /> &nbsp;</p> <p>There are many benefits you can get from innovation management, below are 9 ways it can improve.</p> <p><strong>Help to capture ideas from everyone involved in your organization.</strong></p> <p>With proper innovation management, you will be able to leap the department, location, or language gaps and collect ideas from all the stakeholders involved in your organization. Your employees, customers, suppliers, and partners are the ones who know your business the best. Utilize them to get more ideas, better ideas, and allow ideas to be shared across the organization.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Help to identify great ideas quickly.</strong></p> <p>IMS will help you involve all the stakeholders in your idea generation and idea analysis process. After ideas are collected, a selection process will begin, where the great ideas will be identified quickly and soon proceed to the implementation phase.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Help to reduce costs and boost efficiency.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>From the systematically idea generation and selection process, those not-so-great ideas will be filtered out, and only the good ones will be left and continue. The selection process is also a process where an idea finds its market need or market fit, thus can tremendously reduce the cost for market research and cost for a product&rsquo;s market validation. This in turn helps to reduce a product&rsquo;s time to market, hence boost efficiency in an organization.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Help to better allocate resources in the form of people, money, and time.</strong></p> <p>While using an IMS to gather ideas and allow everyone to comment on the ideas, teams can be formed to further develop the idea or a product based on the idea. This way, people will be involved in things that they are most interested in or believe in, hence can get the most potential out of people. Organizations will also be able to allocate other resources, such as money and time more accurately.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Help to gain and maintain the organization&rsquo;s competitive advantage.</strong></p> <p>The ultimate goal of every organization is to thrive, either by getting the most profits possible, becoming the leader of the industry, or making the world a better place. Innovation management will help organizations gather and evaluate ideas, pick the best ideas efficiently, monetize on these ideas quickly and increase the speed from idea to product, and from product&nbsp; to market.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Help to better engage all your stakeholders.</strong></p> <p>You can involve all stakeholders in the entire process of innovation management. They will feel more engaged and empowered, hence would want to involve more and contribute more. This is a positive circle where your stakeholders will benefit from their ideas and the realization of their ideas, so does the organization itself.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Help to boost collaboration within your organization.</strong></p> <p>Allow your employees to share their ideas, come up with ideas together, work together to improve each other&rsquo;s ideas, and eventually collaborate on the ideas to refine them, and to turn ideas into solutions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Help to create a culture of innovation.</strong></p> <p>Once your stakeholders feel their ideas are treated seriously, their involvement is important, and their ideas are valued, they will feel more engaged and in turn would like to contribute more. This way, organizations can create a culture of innovation, coming up with new ideas and brilliant ideas all the time.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Help to transform organizational culture to an open and transparent one.</strong></p> <p>An IMS will allow all your employees to share their ideas, see each other&rsquo;s ideas, comment on them to help refine the ideas, and follow the progress of the ideas. Your employees will feel engaged the entire idea selection process will be transparent. They will feel more motivated in an open and engaging environment.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Innovation management is crucial to the success of a business. To properly manage innovation, you cannot limit yourself to the traditional ways, such as collecting ideas using suggestion boxes, emails, meetings. To do it right and do it efficiently, an innovation management software that is dedicated to collecting, analyzing, curating, and managing innovative ideas should be in place.

    content: `<p>Innovation is too important to ignore, and too important to fail. If managed improperly, an organization may lose its competitiveness in the market, or worse, be eliminated by its competitors. Innovation is also a complicated subject that involves a lot of resources, people, and need to be managed properly to achieve its ultimately goal - to push the release of new product, process, business flow to an existing or a new market.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To help simplify innovation, we will divide it into five stages, understand each stage and follow through. The five stages of innovation are:</p> <p>1. <strong>Find ideas: </strong>The motivation for innovation stems from every single process of the business. And the direct cause of innovation is the discovery of ideas.</p> <p>2. <strong>Preparation:</strong> Only when it is well prepared, can organizations create new product or process that stands a chance of success.</p> <p>3. <strong>Innovation:</strong> Put ideas into practice, constantly improve and iterate.</p> <p>4. <strong>Market and Expand:</strong> Push the product to the market and spread it though marketing.</p> <p>5. <strong>Learning and Re-innovation</strong></p> <p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/cD3-HMDa2v6a8PRyAFD_IfDynDb4rDhJdP2axv9-5s79_R72pTx8EFtlZiXBirLzyHMzHc6bZQsdZG5pBAC3KkeoSudKmOSbZjkTlFb6bVw74QmZ5TgQDk9CngIxJeuSzk0ygMEn" style="height:171px; width:624px" /></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Next, let us look at each stage in detail and see what is entailed in the full innovation processes.</p> <h2><strong>Stage One: Find Ideas</strong></h2> <p>The need for change could come from everywhere: from the saturated domestic market, organization crisis, changes of business environment, users or customers&#39; feedback, emergences of new competitors, or the sense of mission to reap greater benefits. Inspiration for innovation, or the urgency to create new products, processes, or market, also comes from those places.</p> <p>Searching and finding inspiration that can be turned into innovative initiatives is the key starting point of innovation. There are two main approaches here - they can be used independently, or together:</p> <ul> <li><strong>The proactive approach: </strong>by adopting this approach, an organization is actively looking for new ideas based on its innovation plan and business strategy. Methods used for this approach include idea challenge, and innovation campaigns.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>The demand-driven approach:</strong> ideas coming from customer&#39;s feedback, employees&rsquo; brainstorm sessions based on company&rsquo;s need, or technology change are some of the examples of the demand-driven approach.&nbsp;</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>No matter where the final idea comes from, the important thing is to have an open mind, both at an individual level and at the organization level, and capture the ideas to address real business needs.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Stage Two: Preparation</strong></p> <p>Innovation is not out of thin air, nor is it occasionally acquired, it has a gradual process from old to new. If innovators want to implement their new ideas, they have to draw the enlightenment from the knowledge and experience of their predecessors. This stage includes accumulating knowledge, investigating and studying, collecting and analyzing data, and so on.</p> <p>It is market research that play a vital role at this stage, though market research, organizations will have a fair idea of market demand, market size, feasibility of innovation, and risks of it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Resources is another crucial aspect in innovation. There are two ways to obtain resources: research and development, and technology transfer. At this stage, sometimes organizations can buy ready-made resources, or they can develop the required resources from within.</p> <p>In the stage of concept development and product preparation, the idea itself, resources available, market opportunities, competitiveness, and production demand are combined to determine the framework of the new product. It is important to notice that without the right communication channels, the right progresses for collecting useful data and information, the right infrastructure for implementing ideas, very few of the ideas could be realized.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Stage Three: Innovation</strong></p> <p>After two first stages of development, it is time to turn ideas into final product with thorough preparations and proper testing. The aim of stage three is to develop a ready-to-use product that can be brought to the market. Procedures are being developed, prototypes built and tests carried out.&nbsp;</p> <p>Both of the product and processes should be defined conceptually, and reflected in the prototype of products, and then, should take a test about simulated uses of products. If the prototype does not reflect the desired characteristics, the organization should seek improvements to make up for this difference, and repeat the cycle &ldquo;design-built-test&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the end of the innovation phase, the final sign of ending is products meet the specified requirements and put products into production.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Stage Four: Market and Expansion</strong></p> <p>At this stage, innovative products have been developed maturely. In this stage, the key is to push the product to the market and spread it though marketing and sales initiatives.&nbsp;</p> <p>Because products coming from innovation are normally new and unknown to the majority, organizations should use various marketing methods to promote the product, in order to improve the exposure of the product and make it easier for targeted and interested customers to find the product.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the end of this stage, the new product is transferred to the maintenance phase where it will be continuously evaluated and improved based on customer feedback or market analysis. After the growth period where the market of products has been developed and expanded, it will enter into a mature period, which marks the end of the innovation stage.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Stage Five: Learning and Re-innovation</strong></p> <p>One of the results of an innovation is to provide impetus for the next cycle of innovation. Even if a product or process innovation fails, it still provides valuable insights for organizations for its future innovation endeavors. The stage of learning and adjusting in future innovation process is indispensable. What organizations really need is to grasp the valuable lessons from the success or failure of the past, and apply these experiences to the next innovation process.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Innovation management always entails establishing a process by which an organization can continuously and effectively promote innovative activities. The five stages above are the rough process of innovation. As it should be, this is not a fixed template or a process that must be executed, but to provide a general training of thought for innovator.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> `

    content: `<p>Being able to come up with a brilliant idea does not mean that you can implement it properly, effectively promote the operation of the product, nor find customers who are willing to pay for it. Without a robust management system, the gap between ideas and profitable products is insurmountable. Having a wonderful idea does not mean that you can land it successful.</p> <p>However, having a defined process to take ideas and put them into action would help to ease the pain. Here we summarize the 10 steps from idea collection to growth and profits. We believe it can help guide you through the process.</p> <p><br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>IDEA COLLECTION</strong></p> <p>Ideas can be generated in various ways: from one&rsquo;s &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; moment, a collective brainstorm of a team, or inspirations from things one sees or reads, the list can go on and on. So when there is a good idea, whether you have received an email to an inbox, a note from a suggestion box, a message from a group chat, or a submission in your innovation management system, there is a shared starting point, to collect them systematically.</p> <p><br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>IDEA SELECTION</strong></p> <p>Idea selection is a process of screening out the most promising ideas by using appropriate evaluation system and scientific evaluation methods to analyze and compare various ideas. In this process, you strive to eliminate the most loss and inevitable loss of new product ideas, and select new product ideas with great potential profits.</p> <p>You can consider the following questions when selecting ideas: What is the value of the product? How big is the market? Where is our competitive advantage? What are the risks? Through the analysis of these answers, you can draw a preliminary conclusion about ideas, so as to choose to continue with the idea, or give up on it.</p> <p><br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>FEEDBACK ON THE IDEA</strong></p> <p>After choosing a satisfying idea, you ought to show it to your team and customer base to get the most accurate feedback. Feedback will tell you how confident the team is in implementing, the resistance that may encounter, and the disparity between your considerations and customers.</p> <p><br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>IDEA REFINEMENT</strong></p> <p>Refinement is to specify the economic indicators, technical performance and necessary parameters of product development on the basis of the new product scenario that has been selected. Including the investment scale in product development, profit analysis and market target, ways and implementation plans of product development and so on. A good mechanism is bound to be able to form a win-win multilateral situation, when these things are thought out clearly, we can start product research and development.</p> <p><br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT</strong></p> <p>This is an important stage of turning new product ideas into reality, into the development stage. It mainly involves the development engineers, designers, project managers, and other personnel. The basic activities of this stage are the construction of product prototype, and the development of tools and equipment, which are used in commercial production. The core of product development is the design-build-test cycle. The result of this phrase is the MVP, or Minimum Viable Product.</p> <p><br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>PRODUCT TESTING</strong></p> <p>After the trial development of new products, it is an important evaluation work to conduct a comprehensive test in terms of technology and economy. The test of new products is not only conducive to further improving the design of products and eliminating potential risks, but can also avoid the huge losses that may be caused by mass production of products. It mainly includes the test of the technical performance of the product and the evaluation of the economic benefit of the product.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>PRODUCT TESTING ON THE MARKET</strong></p> <p>Trial sale is actually a market experiment of new products within a limited market scope. Through trial sale, it is possible to check whether consumers are willing to buy new products after they are formally put into the market. Under the changing market conditions, the decision-making and measures that new products should take to enter the market can be checked on the spot.</p> <p>Market trial sale is a comprehensive inspection of new products. It can provide a comprehensive and systematic decision-making basis for whether new products are fully listed or not. It also provides enlightenment for the improvement of new products and the perfection of marketing strategies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>PRODUCT TO MARKET</strong></p> <p>This includes the formal mass production and sales of new products, enterprises should make prudent decisions in the following aspects:</p> <ol> <li>When to launch new products. For competitive products, there are three timing choices: first entry, parallel entry and later entry.</li> <li>Where to launch new products. Whether new products will be promoted to a single region, several regions, a national market or an international market.</li> <li>How to launch new products. Enterprises must formulate detailed marketing plans for new product listing, including marketing mix strategy, marketing budget, organization and control of marketing activities, etc.<br /> &nbsp;</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>PRODUCT ITERATION</strong></p> <p>Product iteration is a continuous process of optimally solving customers&#39; needs with products in the background of limited resources. In the lifecycle of a product, it is very important to plan the iteration scheme of the product. In the process of iteration planning, it is necessary to divide the business reasonably, to ensure that each iteration is completed in a reasonable period of time, and to ensure the quality of products in each iteration. For the business side, the purpose of iteration is to quickly meet the market needs, therefore, when making iterative planning, it is necessary to understand the needs and expectations of the business side. Only constantly updating products can meet the needs of users and the market continuously, achieve generational growth and prosperity.</p> <p><br /> &nbsp;</p> <p><strong>GROWTH AND PROFITS</strong></p> <p>So far, the whole process from idea to product has been completed, the last step is to harvest profits and experience, keep growing and innovating.</p> <p><br /> &nbsp;</p> `

    `<p>Innovation means using new technology and using new ways of thinking to add value to an existing idea or product and to make substantial changes in society.</p> <p>&ldquo;The best way to foresee the future is to create it&rdquo;, which is the best explanation of the importance of innovation. In this article, we will track back to innovation itself, in order to answer why we need innovation and its importance. At a macro level, we will examine what innovation brings to our society. And at a micro level, what does it bring to organizations.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Macro: What does innovation bring to society？</strong></p> <p>Over the past decades, innovation has become the most fundamental way to combat critical risks and threats. It has also brought significant changes and improvements to the society we live in, and is important to the advancement of society as it solves problems and enhances society&#39;s capacity to act.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Scientific and technological innovation is the source of the development of the society as a whole.</strong> History has shown that scientific and technological innovations are the engines of modernization and one of the most important factors for the progress and development of society. The leap from agricultural society to industrial society and information society is largely driven by the development of science and technology.</p> <p>Scientific and technological progress brought by innovation has also greatly improved the level of modern medicines, extended people&rsquo;s life span, improved environmental sustainability, and enhanced environmental sustainability. It is also a major source of economic growth and transformation in our societies.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Economic innovation is the force driving the improvement of socio-economic development.</strong> Advanced technology and increased productivity has brought major changes to one&rsquo;s career today as well. In a PwC report on the future of global economy, it predicts that it will double in size by 2050 because of economic innovation and improvements. In terms of jobs, a report by the World Economic Forum predicts that nearly 133 million new jobs may be created by 2022 while 75 million jobs are displaced by AI, automation and robotics.</p> <p>While manual, low-skilled jobs will be affected, new skill sets are required and it will eventually improve the living standard of people, and boost the economy fundamentally.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Cultural innovation is the basis for the development of social practices.</strong> Culture originates from social practice, at the same time, it guides and restricts the development of social practice. In recent years, archaeologists and anthropologists reconsidered the role of innovation in particular, and have moved toward characterizing innovation in cultural systems not only as a product but also as an evolutionary process. Innovation as a pre-programmed change that occurred when a cultural group &quot;needed&quot; to overcome environmental problems. That is to say, cultural innovation is the substance of cultural development and the inevitable requirement of social practice, and especially is a necessary evolutionary process. The constantly renewed culture enriches the spiritual world and fundamentally improves the sense of happiness in life.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>To sum up, the outcome of innovation on society is as follows:</p> <p>- Development in technology and its accessibility</p> <p>- Improved environmental sustainability</p> <p>- Increased economic growth</p> <p>- Improved well-being（living standard and life span）</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Micro: What does innovation bring to an organization?</strong></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Any organization, like organisms, must constantly adjust and change with the changes of external environment and internal conditions in order to grow and develop smoothly and avoid aging and death. Innovation is the key factor to determine the direction, scale, and speed of the organization&#39;s development. From the whole organization management to the specific business operation, enterprise innovation runs through every department and in every detail. We will examine the outcome of innovation to an organization in the next part of this article.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Innovation can bring about changes in organizational competitiveness and competitive elements</strong>. Innovation constantly optimizes the way that organization operates and enriches the knowledge and skills of employees, which are the most important resources to maintain competitiveness. In addition, with the development and growth of the organization, the competition of the organization will gradually change from the competition of traditional elements to the competition of operational capacity, which is one of the great impacts of innovation.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Innovation is the first factor to promote the development of productivity.</strong> Innovation is permeable and it integrated into productive forces in an all-round way.<strong> </strong>Firstly, innovation continuously improves the quality of workers. From the era of agriculture and industry to the era of information, the overall quality and ability of workers have been continuously improved, which is the result of social progress and innovation. Secondly, innovation keeps updating production tools and technologies. For example, the pilot demonstration project of China Intelligent Manufacturing shows that after Intelligent reformation, the production efficiency can be up to two times, and the operation cost can be reduced by more than 20% on average, up to 60%. The continuous innovation of production tools also directly promotes the knowledge and information upgrade of industrial workers. Thirdly, innovation has created many new forms and products.
