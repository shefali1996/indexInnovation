      '<p>Innovation has been a top priority for the majority of leaders, both at company level and government level. However, deciding which approach will deliver the best ROI in innovation endeavor is not always easy. That is where innovation management comes into play. It takes innovation from a creative-thinking exclusive activity to a logically managed and measurable process. It leverages the collective intelligence of all to identify, curate, and implement the best ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we are going to examine the concept of innovation management, the key aspects of innovation management, and its methodologies and approaches.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>So, first things first, what Is Innovation Management?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of innovation management was first formulated by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter in his book<em> Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy</em> first published in 1943, in which he developed the term &ldquo;creative destruction&rdquo;, referring to industrial forces revolutionizing economic structured from within. Since then, several scholars, thinkers, and entrepreneurs have further developed the theory of innovation management.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we are going to adopt the definition by <a href="https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/innovation-management/">Gartner</a>, an IT research and consultancy company, innovation management is a <a href="https://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/business-innovation">business</a> discipline that aims to drive a sustainable innovation process or culture within an organization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By simply looking at the definition, innovation management is the systematic process of coming up and developing new things, be it a product, workflow, business model, or system and the fostering of innovation culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The key aspects of innovation management</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are various aspects involved in innovation management, they usually include management of the following areas:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ideation</strong>: Making sure ideas from internal or external stakeholders are collected, refined, and implemented efficiently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Resources</strong>: Ensuring that capabilities and materials are at disposal for bringing about innovative changes &ndash; including but not limited to funding, human capital, time, and information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Structures</strong>: Structures enable the effective use of the resources. In practice, this means improving the organizational structure, processes, and infrastructure to optimize innovation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Strategy</strong>: Harnessing resources and ideas to reach innovation goals incrementally or disruptively. Ultimately, innovation is simply one of the means - arguably the most important one, to achieving your strategic goals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Culture</strong>: Creating a pro-innovation culture where new ideas are encouraged, and stakeholders are incentivised to share and comment on insights. It also enables the organization to acquire the best people to achieve its innovation goals, and ultimately, its success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation management always entails establishing a process by which a company can continuously and effectively promote innovative activity. To be effective at managing innovation, it is essential to be able to understand both the big picture, as well as the individual components that make it up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>The methodologies &amp; approaches of innovation management</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation management is complicated, it helps to look at some of the more widely accepted theories and approaches to choose one that fits best to your organization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The types of innovation</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The two broad methodology categories that innovation management typically falls into are &lsquo;incremental&rsquo; and &lsquo;disruptive&rsquo;. While the former involves making consistent improvements to existing products, services, or work processes, the latter involves introducing bolder changes which carry more risk but the possibility of large-scale returns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greg Satell, writer and innovation adviser developed a system called &ldquo;The Innovation Matrix&rdquo;, mapping out the four different types of innovation: basic research, sustaining innovation, disruptive innovation, and breakthrough innovation depending on how well the domain and the problem are defined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are going to combine both, and categorize innovation into 4 different types: incremental &amp; sustaining, incremental &amp; disruptive, radical &amp; sustaining, and radical &amp; disruptive innovations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/gEQhnVN0zi7E8UBo73AGBmvYRDlFlu9LelaG6Ie2k3IMqENbKTfqLFdyUuZSWrn92NH0FxWzhGzsZWoGOaKqQbJ3V0-HV1mc55rF684iFGAR2l5YdcpfrXaKaMBOYkEnT7khHDEV" style="height:379px; width:624px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The approaches to innovation management</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In her famous blog &ldquo;Future of CIO&rdquo;, Pearl Zhu, author and innovation expert summarizes the three management approaches to improve the innovation management success rate in the digital era: an emergent approach, an iterative approach, and an integrative approach. We will combine her insight with our research and experience working with organizations to propose the following three approaches:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The proactive approach</strong>: Proactive innovation management and continuous adaptability are essential in today&rsquo;s rapidly changing world. Managing, changes and innovations should not wait until there is an immediate pressing task.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The integrative approach:</strong> It focuses on how innovation can be best accommodated within an organization&rsquo;s existing structure to create value, and to ensure future growth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The customer-centric approach</strong>: To make sure an innovation will have a positive impact on customers, partners, suppliers, and other stakeholders, the best way is to seek out input from all of them in your innovation endeavors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no size one size fit all success approach for innovation management. It is important for an organization to choose an approach or a mix of different approaches that best address their business. You can also choose different approaches to address different aspects of the business to innovation is managed in the most systematic and efficient way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next article of the same series, we will continue introducing the common models of innovation management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.

      '<p>In the last blog post of the same series, we went through the definition of innovation management, the key aspects of it, and its methodologies and approaches. In this following series, before going through the common models of innovation management, let us take a look at what successful innovation management actually look like.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What does successful innovation management look like?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no simple answer to this question, as it is always dependent on the unique situation of each organization. However, the most innovative companies are normally the ones where the 5 aspects of innovation management - ideation, resources, structures, strategy, and culture aligned with each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From our research, organizations that are considered to be the most innovative, creating disruptive products or technologies all the time tend to have these common characteristics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Have a unique, clearly defined, and relevant strategy that everyone at the organization understands;</li>\r\n\t<li>Accept that failure is always a possibility and are not afraid of it;</li>\r\n\t<li>Structure a repeatable and sustainable innovation process;</li>\r\n\t<li>Trust, encourage, and reward talents;</li>\r\n\t<li>Organize around small teams;</li>\r\n\t<li>Have cross-functional teams with autonomy;</li>\r\n\t<li>Have the resources and structures in place for making sure things happen.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Common models of innovation management</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation management is complicated. To achieve the best possible results in doing it, and to be successful at innovation management, there are some common models organizations could choose from according to their needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common processes for innovation management:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Technology Push vs. Market Pull</li>\r\n\t<li>Phase-Gate Process</li>\r\n\t<li>Lean Startup Model</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Technology Push vs. Market Pull</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The push-based model is a more internally and technologically driven approach, whereas pull-based model is more customer and market-oriented approach for managing innovation. In other words, technology push model is the one where products and processes at the core of innovation, usually driven by internal or external R&amp;D activities, whereas market pull model is driven by and designed to meet the market demand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Push-oriented organizations usually focus on searching for the best ways to address the challenges and the users, usually with new technology. Pull-oriented organizations, in contrast, are looking for ways to adapt to changing markets and customer demand, and usually focus on listening to customers, learning from them and moving fast in their innovation work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While push-oriented organizations are usually traditional and established ones, and pull-oriented ones are operating at an early stage, such as startups, they could usually intertwine. For example, some startups are building technology to solve problems using the push-based model, while some large organizations are taking radical initiatives within the organization.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no better or worse here - they are simply aiming for addressing different challenges. The question to ask is which one of the approaches fit your organization or your need before you choose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Phase-Gate Process</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The phase-gate process (also referred to as a stage-gate process or waterfall process) is probably the most well-known model in developing a new project, product, process, or business initiative. It has been around since the 1940s, and was further refined by Robert Cooper in the 1980s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The process separates the idea development process into five main phases. Between phases, a gate is used to determine whether the development should move to the next phase or an iteration should be applied in the current phase before moving to the next one. It is mainly used to reduce project uncertainty and cycle time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mG9N0EQBWYEN4Gov8rYe84Q9-NK2T9lLw-b1Rzao5HGzUmwNFYM_V-PUoMY3r8ksd2hfBJIQhAiGRNNaY6C2rNSzCGLnKaOEO72NBnAqb8cIoQjHl1woYziT_z9wPCs9_7dP4euc" style="height:201px; width:624px" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The phase-gate process guides idea development through five phases from ideation to launch as follows:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 0: ideation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this phase, organizations tend to discover opportunities through brainstorming and market research among all its stakeholders, including employees, customers, partners, suppliers, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 1: scoping</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main goal in this phase is to evaluate the idea and its market. The strengths and weaknesses of the idea, competition, and customer demand should all be evaluated to determine if the idea is going to move forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 2: building business case</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the last phase of concept development and is crucial before starting with the development of the actual product. There are four main steps to conclude this phase:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Product definition and analysis</strong>: This step provides information to define and justify the development of a new idea;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Building the business case</strong>: This step provides documents that define the idea;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Building the project plan</strong>: This is a list of all tasks that are planned during the entire development process, and the resources it takes to carry them out;&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Feasibility review</strong>: This step analyzes the information provided to decide whether or not the product should move forward.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 3: development</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ultimate deliverable of the development phase is the prototype, which will undergo extensive testing and evaluation in the next phase of the process. The product&#39;s marketing and production plans are also developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 4: testing and validation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The testing includes team testing for problems and issues in the product. Then, it goes for the field test, which includes consumer testing for the product in a beta version and a marketing test to identify market feasibility for the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Phase 5: launch</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The product is introduced to the market based on a pre-defined marketing strategy. In this phase, the marketing and sales team play essential roles in creating the market need and increasing exposure for the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The advantages of the phase-gate process is that it ensures consistency among your ideas and guarantees that each innovation matches the general standards. It also helps reduce complexity for large projects, making the decision-making process smoother. One problem with the process is it would potentially interfere with creativity and innovation, as overly structured processes may cause hinder the largely iterative process of innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>The Lean Startup Model</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The lean startup model is proposed by Eric Ries in his book of the same name. It is a methodology for product and business development. Although it usually is not considered as an innovation management process, it is designed with the same goal as the pull-oriented innovation management approach to address market risk and customer demand fast to find the product market fit as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main idea of the lean startup model is to rapidly test and validate the assumptions related to the product market fit between your idea or innovation and your target market in order to learn and adapt as fast as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Build-measure-learn</strong> is the main component of the lean startup model. It is a framework for establishing and continuously improving new ideas, products, and services quickly and cost-effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building <strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP) </strong>is another main concept in this model. The idea is, instead of taking a lot of time and resources to build a product that nobody knows if there is a market fit, build the most version of it to test the water.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lean startup model is a faster way to learn what works. Organizations are able to increase the speed of development and reduce development costs, thus lowering the overall risk of innovation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What is the right model for your organization?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To figure out the right innovation management model for your organization can be challenging, as innovation is higher unpredictable and the only way to see if something works for you is to actually try it out. We do, however, have some tips to help you figure out it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Analyse your current situation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Educate yourself on all the models.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Start simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Keep testing until you find the right fit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And keep in mind that there is no right or wrong, better or worse, there is only fit or not fit. And if you are working in a larger organization, you will almost inevitably need more than one model for different types of innovations in different parts of the organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next article of the series, we will take a look at key innovation metrics to drive innovation.

      '<p>In the previous articles of the same series, we have gone through the fundamentals of innovation management, where we learnt its definition, key aspects, approaches, and common models. In this one, we will discuss more on the key innovation metrics to measure and how to get the most of it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Metrics are important levers of innovation &ndash; for driving behavior, evaluating the results of specific initiatives, as well as guiding you in allocating resources. However, due to the abstract and somewhat uncertain nature of innovation, finding the right metrics to measure innovation can be tricky. It is easy to pick some metrics that are simple, without thinking whether they are the important ones that will actually be useful to your business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important thing in measuring innovation is to ensure that you are going in the right direction. To set the correct metrics, you should measure not only in the traditional ways, i.e. measuring return on investment, but also see if the organization, leadership, and resources are in line with your business goals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Input vs. output metrics</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To put it simply, the input and output metrics are used to measure what goes into your innovation process and what comes out of it. The input metrics are to measure if you are taking the right initiatives and if you are allocating your resources properly, whereas the output metrics are to measure the results they bring and if they are the desired results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Input metrics are a great starting point for measuring innovation in the early stage because they are straightforward and tangible. It is, however, important to have in mind that input does not guarantee output.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>Key types of innovation metrics</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Broadly speaking, there are three types of metrics when it comes to measuring innovation - return on investment metrics, capability &amp; structure metrics, and leadership metrics. We will briefly introduce each type of them and some examples in regards to what exactly to measure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Return on investment metrics</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ROI metrics are the most straightforward metrics of all, they focus on measuring resource investments and financial returns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<table cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse; width:624px">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Input metrics</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Output metrics</strong></p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>No. of ideas submitted</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>No. of new products, services, and businesses launched</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>No. of campaign / challenge launched and no. of ideas submitted for each of them</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Revenue / profit gained from the new launches</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Money spent on implementing the ideas</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>No. of the new market entered</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>Time spent on developing and implementing the ideas</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>% of the market share</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t\t<tr>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">&nbsp;</td>\r\n\t\t\t<td style="vertical-align:top">\r\n\t\t\t<p>% of ideas implemented vs ideas submitted</p>\r\n\t\t\t</td>\r\n\t\t</tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Capability, culture &amp; structure metrics</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Capability and structure metrics refer to the infrastructure and process an organization has to facilitate innovation.

It involves continuous planning, monitoring, and learning &amp; improving.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Planning:</strong> Involving key stakeholders in identifying the key metrics to insure they are clear and align with the organization&rsquo;s business strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Tracking metrics against business goals to determine the progress and make necessary adjustments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Learning &amp; improving: </strong>A process where an organization reviews its metrics and progress, engaging its key stakeholders in improving its use of current metrics, identifying new metrics, and achieving business objectives.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few tips to create goal-driven innovation metrics:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Clarify organization business objectives</li>\r\n\t<li>Define actionable innovation goals&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Identify innovation-related leadership behaviors</li>\r\n\t<li>Identify organizational processes required to drive incremental and disruptive innovation</li>\r\n\t<li>Create metrics that support the innovation strategy of the company</li>\r\n\t<li>Review and improve strategies and metrics on an ongoing basis</li>\r\n\t<li>Do not force the same metrics on every process or everyone</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it can be rather difficult to choose what to measure, measuring innovation is not rocket science. It is critical to engage key stakeholders in every process and make sure the metrics are not overwhelmed but are aligned with the business strategy and objectives. And one should also keep in mind that metrics should not be standing alone but rather a part of an organization&rsquo;s growth plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n'
